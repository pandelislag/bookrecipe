## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project helps me to explore the technology of Bootstrap 5. I learn how to interact with a css Framework and see how quick we can create a beautifull UI. Also i combine two technologies Bootstrap 5 and Vanilla JS.

### Continued development

In future projects i would like to learn more consepts about css Framework like Sass. Also i want to learn some libraries like ReactJS and React Router DOM.
